                        <p>The Comox Valley Farmers' Market (CVFM) and North Vancouver Island Culinary Association (NVICA) want to take things “back to the basics” at Foodfest this year.  As part of our commitment to promote, support and educate about local agriculture, CVFM & NVICA are hosting an information sessions at the Saturday Farmers’ Market.  Rather than just cooking & serving CVFM vendor’s products as we have in the past, we want to share the wealth of knowledge that our valley chefs have for menu planning, cost-cutting, in-season buying & making the best use of our local products, we will also be sharing basic recipes.</p>

                        <p>The Comox Valley Exhibition will be hosting their 146 th annual Fall Fair this weekend at the Comox Valley Exhibition Grounds on Headquarters Rd. Have no fear though, the farmers’ market will still be held in our usual place at our usual time (Market Field of CV Exhibition Grounds; 9 AM-1 PM). The only change this year will be that parking at the Curling Rink will be reserved for handicap parking only.  Market patrons will be directed to park at Vanier School. From the parking lot pedestrians will be directed to the market entrance. See the map below for more details. Bringing local food to local folks since 1992!</p>
