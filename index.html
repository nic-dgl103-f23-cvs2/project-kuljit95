As part of our commitment to promote, support and educate about local agriculture, CVFM & NVICA are hosting an information sessions at the Saturday Farmers’ Market.  Rather than just cooking & serving CVFM vendor’s products as we have in the past, we want to share the wealth of knowledge that our valley chefs have for menu planning, cost-cutting, in-season buying & making the best use of our local products. While we will be focusing on all these subjects, we will also be sharing basic recipes.</p>
